# Simple-Node.js-HTTP-Server-with-Form-Handling-and-File-Storage
This project is a basic Node.js HTTP server that demonstrates how to handle form submissions without using frameworks like Express. It serves an HTML form for collecting a username and gender, processes the POST request using Node’s built-in http and fs modules, and stores the submitted data in a text file (user.txt).
